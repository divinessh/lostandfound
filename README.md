# Lost and Found Campus Web App
>A web app for students to submit details about lost and found items around campus

## About The Project
As a student, I've noticed many students having belongings lost and found. However, many students struggle to share information regarding these items and are sometimes not conveyed to all . Some students even try using platforms like Telegram Confession pages which are unorganized and messages can get lost up across various new messages which ends up in certain belongings not being found at all. 

Thus, I have made this web app that can be implemented by college institutions for lost and found items on campus. It is simple and convenient and also displays recently lost and found items to make it easy to access information regarding the issue.
